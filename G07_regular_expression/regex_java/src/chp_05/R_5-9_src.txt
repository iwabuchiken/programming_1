The earliest known recipes date from approximately 1600 BC and come from an Akkadian tablet from southern Babylonia.[1]
There are ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics depicting the preparation of food.[citation needed]
Many ancient Greek recipes are known. Mithaecus's cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost; Athenaeus quotes one short recipe in his Deipnosophistae. Athenaeus mentions many other cookbooks, all of them lost.[2]
Roman recipes are known starting in the 2nd century BCE with Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura. Many other authors of this period described eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and in Latin.[2]
Some Punic recipes are known in Greek and Latin translation.[2]
Much later, in the 4th or 5th century, appears the large collection of recipes conventionally entitled 'Apicius', the only more or less complete surviving cookbook from the classical world.[2] It chronicles the courses served which are usually referred to as Gustatio (appetizer), Primae Mensae (main course) and Secundae Mensae (dessert).[3] The Romans introduced many herbs and spices into western cuisine, Renfrew[4] states that basil, bay, dill, fennel, mint, parsley, rue and thyme were all common in Roman cooking.
