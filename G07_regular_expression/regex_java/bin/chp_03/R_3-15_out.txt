The domestic <cat>[1][2] (Felis <cat>us or Felis silvestris <cat>us[4]) is a small, usually furry, domesti<cat>ed, carnivorous mammal. It is often called the house<cat>,[6] or simply the <cat> when there is no need to distinguish it from other felids and felines. Cats are valued by humans for companionship and ability to hunt vermin and household pests.
Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. As crepuscular predators, <cat>s use their acute hearing and ability to see in near darkness to lo<cat>e prey. Not only can <cat>s hear sounds too faint for human ears, they can also hear sounds higher in frequency than humans can perceive. This is because the usual prey of <cat>s (particularly rodents such as mice) make high frequency noises, so the hearing of the <cat> has evolved to pinpoint these faint high-pitched sounds. Cats also have a much better sense of smell than humans.
Despite being solitary hunters, <cat>s are a social species, and <cat> communi<cat>ion includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting) as well as pheromones and types of <cat>-specific body language.[7]
Cats have a rapid breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as <cat> fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet <cat>s by spaying and neutering and the abandonment of former household pets has resulted in large numbers of feral <cat>s worldwide, with a population of up to 60 million of these animals in the United States alone.[8]
Since <cat>s were cult animals in ancient Egypt, it was commonly believed to have been domesti<cat>ed there,[9] but there may have been instances of domesti<cat>ion as early as the Neolithic.[10] A genetic study in 2007 revealed that all house <cat>s are descended from as few as five female African Wild<cat>s (Felis silvestris lybica) c. 8000 BCE, in the Middle East.[9][11] Cats are currently the most popular pet in the world, now found almost everywhere in the world.[12]
